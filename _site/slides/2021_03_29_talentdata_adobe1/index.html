                         While Adobe can be considered in the median range for overall employee diversity, an analysis of what the numbers look like at different seniority levels shows how <span style="color:#e31e1c">Adobe falls behind in keeping a consistent rate of female talent throughout the career ladder</span>. It is worth noting that the numbers on the total junior employees are in most cases very small, and thus might not be very representative of the category. Because of this, it is more accurate to evaluate the drop between intermediate and senior employees, which have more comparable sample sizes.
                    </p>            
                    
                    <p class="r-fit-text">
                         As seniority level increases, the share of female talent represented in a company's workforce decreases. This pattern is present in almost all of the companies considered, but the drop is particularly stark for Adobe, which goes from being the 6<sup>th</sup> company for share of intermediate female employees to being the 13<sup>th</sup> for share of senior female employees. 
                    </p>  
                    
                    <p class="r-fit-text">
                         A similar pattern is also found when considering ethnically diverse talent, with Adobe having 15% ethnically diverse intermediate employees in the sample and 10% ethnically diverse seniors, dropping from the 4<sup>th</sup> most diverse company at intermediate level to 13<sup>th</sup> at senior level.

                        <p><b>COMPETITORS' & BENCHMARK</b></p>
                        <li>Adobe is overall in line with competitors' median diversity. There are however some companies that fare better, in particular smaller companies like Twilio, Tableau and Box. </li>
                        <li>There is the need to increase diversity at senior level. While for ethnically diverse talent the relative drop at senior level is similar in size to that of competitors, for gender diversity it is bigger as the share of female employees drops of about 20 percentage points going from junior to senior level.</li>

                        <li>Current location can suggest possible hiring hotspots for diverse talent. In particular, German cities like Berlin, Walldorf, and Frankfurt in Germany, or British cities like Reading, seem to have a high rate of diverse talent while also being places where Adobe has little or zero employees in the sample considered. This matter needs to be investigated further to rule out bias in the data that could influence the results - like the presence of big corporate headquarters in otherwise small cities.</li></ul>

                        <li>Universities attended by the employees considered can suggest institutions were recruiting is more likely to result in the hire of diverse talent. There is no university being a significant feeder of female talent. The most common (Essec Business School, The Open University, The Chartered Institute Of Marketing, Bournemouth University and University Of Portsmouth) have been cited by at most 1.5% of the female talent pool. </li>
                        
                        <li>As for ethnically diverse talent, the most frequent universities are all in the United Kingdom: Brunel University London (cited by 3% of the ethnically diverse talent pool) , Kingston University (2%) and Aston University (2%). A challenge with this data is that some deeper cleaning is needed to standardize names and perhaps bring more accurate insights.  </li>
