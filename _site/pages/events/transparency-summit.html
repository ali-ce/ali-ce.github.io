<p>I was recently in Berlin to attend the <a href="https://cdt.org/blog/human-rights-and-surveillance-governments-must-comply-with-their-transparency-obligations/">Transparency Summit</a> organized by the <a href="https://cdt.org/">Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a>, the <a href="https://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/">Global Network Initiative</a> and Google on the eve of the Eurodigg conference.</p>

<p>(Chatham House Rules apply)</p>

<p>The summit hosted key stakeholders from governments, businesses and civil society organization to discuss surveillance and transparency. Specifically, the debate focused on the transparency reports disclosing data on governments’ requests for users data published by telecommunication companies like Google and Vodafone.</p>

<p>I was invited to discuss <a href="/works/2014/04/18/transparency-DB">my project aggregating transparency reports</a> by these companies in a single aggregated database. I spoke of how the tool can be used by researchers and reporters, and of the challenges I faced when normalizing different reporting standards. I argued for the need of a standardized format, without which there can’t be a real and fundamental transparency benefit from such disclosures. More about the project <a href="/works/2014/04/18/transparency-DB">here</a>.</p>
