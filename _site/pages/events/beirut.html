<p>I’ve just got back from Beirut, where I was a trainer at the Data4Change workshop, organized by <a href="https://smallmedia.org.uk/">Small Media</a> and <a href="http://visualizingimpact.org/">Visualizing Impact</a>. The 5-day event connected human rights organizations from the MENA region with international experts in data research, coding and design.</p>

<p>The results are five impressive data-driven advocacy campaigns on topics like corruption in Lebanon, housing policies in Cairo, counting fatalities in Syria, and much more. You can read about them all <a href="https://smallmedia.org.uk/work/data4change-beirut">here</a>.</p>

<p>Other than assisting the HRO in organizing the data-driven part of their campaigns, I also gave a PechaKucha talk on how to publish data in way that’s transparent and empowering for the user. <a href="https://smallmedia.org.uk/work/data4change-beirut">Here</a>’s the slideshow.</p>
