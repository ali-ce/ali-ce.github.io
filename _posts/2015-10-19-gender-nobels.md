Data-driven project looking at women Nobels. Did you know that less than 6% of the 874 (human) laureates are women? <!--more-->

And thank God for Marie Curie, who won two Nobel prizes and is counted twice. 

As soon as the 2015 Nobel prizes were announced, here at Silk we decided to dig into the data on all the winners published. For that we turned to Wikipedia and the Nobel Prize Website. This year very few women won Nobels so we decided to analyze gender statistics for the prizes over time. We knew it would be male dominated. But the extent to which this was true surprised us. Less than 6% of the 874 (human) laureates are women. And thank God for Marie Curie, who won two Nobel prizes. She is counted twice.
And while we're at it, consider that it's been more than half a century since a woman won a Physics Nobel Prize.
