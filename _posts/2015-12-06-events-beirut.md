I’ve just got back from Beirut, where I was a trainer at the Data4Change workshop, organized by [Small Media](https://smallmedia.org.uk/) and [Visualizing Impact](http://visualizingimpact.org/). The 5-day event connected human rights organizations from the MENA region with international experts in data research, coding and design.

The results are five impressive data-driven advocacy campaigns on topics like corruption in Lebanon, housing policies in Cairo, counting fatalities in Syria, and much more. You can read about them all [here](https://smallmedia.org.uk/work/data4change-beirut).

Other than assisting the HRO in organizing the data-driven part of their campaigns, I also gave a PechaKucha talk on how to publish data in way that’s transparent and empowering for the user. [Here](https://smallmedia.org.uk/work/data4change-beirut)’s the slideshow.
