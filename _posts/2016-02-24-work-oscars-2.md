A data-driven analysis of gender representation among nominees and winners throughout the 88 years of Academy Awards.
<!--more-->

Over the 88 editions of the Academy Awards, several things have remained constant. The Red Carpet. The golden statuette. And the absence of women nominees.

Which isn’t to say that women are absent from the event. During the Academy Awards season, pictures of actresses monopolize the front pages of websites, magazines, newspapers, and TV shows. Their bodies are discussed, their designer clothes, their hairstyles, their make-up, their dates.

And still, very few women are actually nominated for an Oscar. And even less win one.

Let’s look at numbers. Did you know that in the history of the awards, only 17% of the nominees have been women? Or that in the upcoming 2016 Oscars, five categories had no female nominee at all? In this Silk, I explored the data behind the Gender Gap at the prestigious Academy Awards. Read [the findings](https://medium.com/silk-stories/latest-data-reveals-the-actual-size-of-the-gender-gap-at-the-academy-awards-ad2fff99ef13#.80eseekal) and explore [the full database](http://academy-awards-data.silk.co/).
