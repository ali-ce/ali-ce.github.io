Data analysis of 6,000 movies and their Bechdel Test scores. From Pauvre Pierrot (1892) to Jurassic World (2015). 
<!--more-->

Started as a joke in Alison Bechdel’s comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For (1985), the Bechdel Test is now one of the standards used by critics to assess gender bias in films. In order to pass the Bechdel, a movie must meet 3 criteria: it has to have at least two (named) women in it (1), who talk to each other (2), about something besides a man (3).

In this article, I analyzed Bechdel Test information for almost 6,000 movies released between 1892 and 2015. For each movie, I pulled in information from IMDb (such as director, genre, actors, plot keywords…). I then matched the films to information we collected from [bechdeltest.com](http://www.bechdeltest.com), about whether or not the movies had passed the three criteria.
