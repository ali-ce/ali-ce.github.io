Data visualizations on half a century of Playmates.
<!--more-->

The ideal playmate is “the girl next door with her clothes off”, according to Playboy’s founder Hugh Hefner.

Marilyn Monroe was the first model that posed for Playboy’s centerfold. It was December 1953. Sixty-two years and 737 issues later, America’s “girl next door” surely has changed. Some speculate that female bodies on Playboy have become more athletic. Others have pointed at the increasing impact of plastic surgery and at the number of models with unrealistic breasts sizes. Academic studies have analyzed the correlation between economic conditions and Playmates’ curves. Others have stressed America’s increasing BMI, and argued that the gap between the “girl next door” and the girl depicted in Playboy covers is getting wider and wider.

To make sense of this, we’ve gathered, organized and visualized information on all the 739 girls that have posed in Playboy’s centerfolds. From the “Sweetheart of the Month” in the December 1953 issue to Kaylia Cassandra’s June 2015 centerfold. Let us tell you the stories that we found in the data.
