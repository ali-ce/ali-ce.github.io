Platform for citizen monitoring of Italian EU funded projects.
<!--more-->

Allows citizens to monitor the projects funded through the European Regional policy and to collect citizens’ report on their status.

Collaborates with schools and local agencies to organize “monitoring marathons” on the territory, to assess the status and functioning of projects funded by EU funds.

The project featured at OKCon in Geneva in September 2013.

*Note: This is a team project. I was involved with the initial developed during the 2013 Hackathon at the [International Journalism Festival in Perugia](http://dataninja.it/projects/hackathon/) and in the months after. Now I'm not actively involved in the project anymore.
