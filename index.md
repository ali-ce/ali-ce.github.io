<p style="font-size:1.1em;">I'm a <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">data journalist and data-driven storyteller</text>. I <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">counsel NGOs, non-profits and businesses</text> on researching and producing data-driven stories. I give <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">talks, trainings and workshops</text> on data-driven storytelling techniques and best practices. I'm available to carry out <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">academic and journalistic research</text>. Thanks to [a fund](https://digitalnewsinitiative.com/dni-projects/batjo-bits-atoms-and-journalism-round-4/) from Google’s Digital News Initiative, I’m in the process of founding my own company, producing research and solutions at the intersection of data, journalism and digital fabrication. I was lead data journalist and trainer at Silk.co, a semantic web platform for publishing and visualizing data. Before, I've crafted data journalism stories and data visualizations for digital and print Italian news outlets. I privilege the use of open source tools and/or of coding. I have a background in History and a MA specializing in data journalism. I'm Italian, currently based in Venice (Italy).
