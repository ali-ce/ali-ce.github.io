<p style="font-size:1.1em;">I'm a freelance <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">data journalist and data-driven storyteller</text>. I <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">counsel NGOs, non-profits and businesses</text> on researching and producing data-driven stories. I give <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">talks, trainings and workshops</text> on data-driven storytelling techniques and best practices. I'm available to carry out <text style="color:#FF6B6B;">academic and journalistic research</text>. I was lead data journalist and trainer at <a href="http://www.silk.co">Silk.co</a>, a semantic web platform for publishing and visualizing data. Before, I've crafted data journalism stories and data visualizations for digital and print Italian news outlets. I privilege the use of open source tools and/or of coding. I have a background in History and a MA specializing in data journalism. I'm Italian, currently based in Amsterdam (NL).
