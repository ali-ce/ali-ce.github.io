***ENG: The 2011 war in Libya in Italian newspapers: media's representation of a conflict of 'national interest'***

When Italian media were faced the task to inform the public on the events of the war in Libya, how did they respond? This thesis is a data-driven analysis arguing how the nine major Italian newspapers, rather than informing the public, produced a war narrative that was biased, country-centric, 'entertaining', distorted and functional to the mainstream political discourse.
