I’ve just returned from Potsdam, Germany to attend the M100 Sanssouci Colloquium (this year’s topic: Media Freedom in the Age of Big Data).

Luckily, I was also selected to attend the week-long Young European Journalist Workshop “Data and Journalism: Between big stories and dirty surveillance.

About the workshop: *“The M100 Young European Journalists Workshop aims to introduce 20 to 25 selected participants from all over Europe to both sides of dealing with data: both the technical principles as well as the professional, responsible use of data and its benefits, but also the risks faced every day as a journalist. Not least, participation in the M100 Sanssouci Colloquium, which will be attended by 50 to 60 senior editors, academics, bloggers, politicians and representatives of major Internet companies from Europe and the USA on 12 September 2014. The subject of ‘Media Freedom in the Era of Big Data’ will be discussed in two sessions, giving the participants a deeper insight and knowledge of this subject”*.

For the workshop, I teamed up 3 fellow journalists from Ukraine and Czeck Republic to work on an exclusive dataset about criminality in Ukraine in the months before and after the revolution. We investigated how the Maiden Revolution has impacted crime patterns in Kiev. See more [here](http://m100-workshop.com/projects/project_kievCrime.html).
