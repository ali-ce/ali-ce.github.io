You can insert positive values on top and negative values on the bottom of the map, for an effect that is impossible to really obtain with 2D graphics. The same techniques can be used for data driven extrusion of any type of geometry: grids, administrative boundaries, buildings, etc. *(Worked on concept, story and data preparation)*.

- [Light Data Bars](https://batjo.eu/cookbook/light-bars/){:target="_blank" class="project-title" id="yellow"} **(2018)**<br>A physical data installation that promotes an informal and participative approach to data. Each LED bar has a switch to set one of the two possible modes. If the switch is in position 1, the number of LEDs that light up is determined by the data. If the switch is in position two, the participant has to try to guess the correct data value by applying an amount of force on a sensor (more force = higher value) and the LEDs light up accordingly to such value. In the interaction, the user is both grasping a general feel of quantities through a non-visual sense, while also being surprised by how close or far its guesses are. *(Worked on concept, story and data preparation)*.
